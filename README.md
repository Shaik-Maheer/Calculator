## Simple Calculator with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project implements a basic calculator with the following features:

- User interface with a clear display area for input and results.
- Numeric buttons (`0-9`) for entering numbers.
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) for performing calculations.
- An `AC` button for clearing the display.
- An `=` button to evaluate the expression and display the result.
- Basic visual styling using CSS for a user-friendly interface.

## Functionality

**Components:**

- **HTML:** The core structure is built using HTML elements like `div`, `form`, `input`, etc.
- **CSS:** Styles the layout, background colors, text appearance, and button behavior.
- **JavaScript (Inline):** 
    - Updates the display value when numeric buttons are clicked.
    - Evaluates the expression using `eval()` when the `=` button is clicked (**Note:** Using `eval()` can be a security risk. Consider alternative libraries like math.js for safer evaluation).
    - Clears the display when the `AC` button is clicked.

## Customization

- You can modify the CSS styles to personalize the visual appearance of the calculator.
- Add additional buttons and functions to extend the calculator's capabilities (e.g., percentage, memory functions).
- Improve the error handling for invalid user inputs.
- Consider using safer methods like `math.js` for expression evaluation if security is a concern.
